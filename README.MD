CXA UI
======
CXA UI is a lightweight, data-oriented frontend web framework. It includes the necessary style and structure components to rapidly build and maintain small, good-looking, mobile-friendly forms and control panels.
CXA UI is not a complete drop in solution; it takes a bit of fiddling with. It just helps get you started with your webapp.
CXA (CompetiX Architecture) isa data-oriented webapp framework derived from CompetixCMS, and is available in multiple versions depending on how much and what framework you want.
CXA UI is frontend-only (although the examples require PHP), and is the first CXA component to be open-sourced.
